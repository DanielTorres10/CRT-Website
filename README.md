## About the website
The electrical and software division designed the website during Summer 2019. To mantain it, during 2020 we uploaded the source code to GitHub to make it easier for future members to pick up where we left off.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account and being a member of the team. //congrats!
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
- An IDE to work on the code, we'll be using Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Github Pull Requests and Issues](vscode:extension/GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension on VSCode.

## Set up Git on VSCode

## Pushing to GitHub
